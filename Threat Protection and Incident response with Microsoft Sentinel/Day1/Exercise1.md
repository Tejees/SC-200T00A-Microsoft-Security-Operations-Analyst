# Exercise 1 - Microsoft Sentinel Deployment

## Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will set up the foundational components required for Microsoft Sentinel. First, you will create a Log Analytics Workspace, it is a central repository where your security data will be collected, stored, and queried. This workspace serves as the backbone for Sentinel’s analytics and threat detection capabilities.

Next, you will deploy Microsoft Sentinel to the newly created workspace. Deploying Sentinel integrates advanced security analytics, threat intelligence, and incident response features into your environment. By completing this exercise, you will establish the core infrastructure that enables you to monitor security events, detect potential threats, and investigate incidents in subsequent exercises.

## Lab Objectives
 In this lab, you will perform the following:

- Task 1: Create a Log Analytics Workspace
- Task 2: Deploy Microsoft Sentinel to a workspace

### Task 1: Create a Log Analytics Workspace

In this task, you will create a Log Analytics workspace for use with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type **Log Analytics workspaces (1)**, then select **Log Analytics workspaces (2)**.
