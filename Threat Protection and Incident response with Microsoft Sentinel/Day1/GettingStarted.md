# Threat Protection and Incident response with Microsoft Sentinel within Unified Platform - Day 1

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview
 
In this lab, you will get hands-on experience with Microsoft Sentinel. Participants will learn how to deploy Sentinel, integrate critical data sources, enrich security insights using threat intelligence and content packs, and leverage User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to detect anomalous activities.
By completing this lab, learners will be equipped to set up a robust security monitoring environment, detect potential threats, and initiate effective incident response measures.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, participants will be able to:

  - **Deploy Microsoft Sentinel** to a Log Analytics workspace for centralized security data collection and analysis.

  - **Enable and configure data connectors** to ingest security logs from various Microsoft and third-party services.

  - **Getting a Connector via the Microsoft Security Store​** to ingest security logs from supported Microsoft and third-party services.

  - **Integrate threat intelligence** feeds and deploy relevant analytics/content from the Content Hub to enhance detection capabilities.

  - **Enable and use UEBA** in Microsoft Sentinel to detect abnormal user and entity behaviors.

Understand the role of each component in the threat detection and incident response workflow.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have:

- Basic understanding of Microsoft Azure services and portal navigation.

- Experience with Defender portal.

- Familiarity with security concepts such as SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence.

- Experience with log analysis or security event monitoring.

## Architecture

In this lab, you will use Microsoft Sentinel to collect, analyze, and respond to security events from multiple data sources. The workflow begins by deploying a Log Analytics workspace and enabling Microsoft Sentinel for centralized log collection. You will connect various security data sources using built-in data connectors, including Azure Active Directory, Microsoft 365 Defender, and other supported services.Threat intelligence will be integrated into Sentinel to enrich alerts with known malicious indicators, enhancing the accuracy of detections. You will explore the Content Hub to deploy prebuilt analytics rules, hunting queries, and workbooks for faster detection and visualization. Additionally, you will enable User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to profile normal user activity and detect anomalies.

Throughout the lab, you will investigate generated incidents, run hunting queries, and use automated playbooks to respond to threats, simulating a complete security operations workflow from detection to remediation.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

1. **Log Analytics Workspace:** A central repository where Sentinel stores ingested log data.
   - Acts as the backend for Sentinel’s analytics and hunting capabilities.
   - Supports Kusto Query Language (KQL) for querying logs.

1. **Data Connectors:** Pre-built integrations that allow ingestion of logs and telemetry from various services:
   - Microsoft sources: Microsoft 365 Defender, Azure AD, Azure Activity, Security Events.
   - Non-Microsoft sources: Firewalls, endpoint solutions, SaaS applications.
   - Configured in Sentinel’s Data Connectors blade. 

1. **Threat Intelligence Connector:** Enables ingestion of threat indicators (IP addresses, domains, URLs, file hashes) from external or internal sources.
   - Enhances detection rules by correlating indicators with ingested telemetry.
   - Supports integration with Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (MDTI) or TAXII-based feeds.

1. **Content Hub:** A repository of packaged security solutions (workbooks, analytics rules, hunting queries, playbooks, data connectors) for specific products, threats, or industries.
   - Allows quick deployment of best-practice detections and visualizations. 

1. **UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics):** A Sentinel feature that builds behavioral profiles for users and entities based on ingested data.
   - Detects anomalies by comparing current activity to baseline behavior.
   - Useful for detecting insider threats, compromised accounts, and suspicious activity.

1. **Kusto Query Language (KQL):** The query language used to search and analyze data within Sentinel.
   - Powers analytics rules, hunting queries, and workbooks.
   - Essential for creating custom detections.
